Turf / Ground Booking System
------------------------------
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: Turf / Ground Booking System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
Development Tool: Cursor IDE
A full-stack web application designed to automate sports turf and ground reservations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Currently, turf booking is handled manually through phone calls or direct visits.
Users face difficulty in checking slot availability and often experience double booking.
Payments are usually handled offline, causing confusion and lack of proper records.
There is no centralized system to track bookings and manage schedules efficiently.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROPOSED SOLUTION

A web application where users can view available turfs and real-time slot availability.
Users can book slots and make online payments directly from the platform.
Ground Managers manage turf details and slot schedules.
Payment Managers verify transactions and handle refunds.
Admins monitor the entire system and manage users and system operations.
